Code and trained model for extracting feature representations from benthic images from *Ecology at scale: Enabling real time learning for automated global reef monitoring in the (Reef)Cloud*

To install:

    pip install -e .

Add the image set to `data\input_data`. The Catlin Seaview Survey data can be accessed from the University of Queensland
[here](http://doi.org/10.14264/uql.2019.930)

Feature representations from the images can be generated by running
